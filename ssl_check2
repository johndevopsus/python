'''You can use the `requests` library in Python to make HTTPS connections and the `ssl` library to check the certificate details. Here's a simple script that should help you get started:'''

```python
import requests
import ssl
from datetime import datetime

websites = ['https://www.example1.com', 'https://www.example2.com', 'https://www.example3.com']

for website in websites:
    try:
        response = requests.get(website, timeout=5)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses
        cert = ssl.get_server_certificate((website.split('//')[1].split('/')[0], 443))
        x509 = ssl.load_certificate(ssl.PEM_CERTIFICATE, cert)
        expiration_date = datetime.strptime(x509.get_notAfter().decode('utf-8'), '%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ')
        remaining_days = (expiration_date - datetime.utcnow()).days

        print(f'{website}: Certificate is valid. Remaining days until expiration: {remaining_days} days')
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f'{website}: Unable to connect. Error: {e}')
    except ssl.SSLError as e:
        print(f'{website}: Certificate error. Error: {e}')
```

Make sure to install the `requests` library if you haven't already by running:

```bash
pip install requests
```

This script attempts to make an HTTPS connection to each website, prints if the connection cannot
